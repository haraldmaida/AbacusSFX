Abacus - Application implemented using [ScalaFX](https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx) as UI-framework/toolkit and [ScalaTestFX](https://github.com/haraldmaida/ScalaTestFX) for automated UI-tests.

## Goals

The two goals of this project are:
1. creating a small application to demonstrate the usage of [ScalaTestFX](https://github.com/haraldmaida/ScalaTestFX) with.

2. playing around with different styles of writing test code to find most efficient ways of writing and maintaining test cases for automated UI-tests.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a small ScalaFX application to demonstrate the usage of ScalaTestFX based on a "real world" application. While i was groping around for ideas what this application should be I stumbled over the [Abacus JavaFX application created by Dierk](https://github.com/Dierk/learnJavaFx) as a tutorial application for learning JavaFX.

So inspired by Dierk's Abacus application I got fascinated of Abaci in general.

## Status

A first version of the Abacus application is finished and works quite well.

Now it's time to write the ScalaTestFX test cases ;-)
